The project discusses recent advancements in artificial intelligence technology, which integrates computing, big data, and machine learning algorithms to recognize, learn, infer, and act on external information across various fields. It highlights the widespread application of AI in industries and the efforts by machine learning experts to make ML tools accessible to non-experts. The researchers are focusing on autonomous machine learning and standardizing ML concepts through ontology construction. The paper classifies typical problem-solving steps in autonomous machine learning as tasks and proposes a problem-solving process. It introduces a task ontology-based machine learning model that uses UML activities to define task-based process grouping schemes. The model aims to automatically generate and extend machine learning models using transformation rules based on common elements and structures.
